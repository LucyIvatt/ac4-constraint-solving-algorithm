This repository contains a python implementation of the AC4 constraint solving algorithm.

An example of using this algorithm for constraint solving is shown within the script. The domain and constraints have been defined for the [NQueens Problem](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/n-queen-problem-backtracking-3/)
